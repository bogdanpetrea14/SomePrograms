## Infinite Product

The "power" subroutine raises a number to a chosen power, and in combination with the "base_transform" subroutine, they transform numbers read from base 10 into base 8. The entire program calculates the scalar product of two vectors, as well as the second maximum from each vector and their norms.

## Simple Queries

The program reads characters until it encounters an invalid one, i.e., not a lowercase letter or E, T, or Q. The program calculates the frequency of letters and displays alerts when the frequency of a letter is greater than 50% of the total number of letters entered up to that point. The "sorting" subroutine sorts a copy of the frequency vector so that those that appear in the string are sorted in descending order based on the number of occurrences, and the rest are sorted alphabetically.

## Gigel and the Checkboard

The program reads from the keyboard a "chessboard," with each position containing an integer, each position corresponding to a black or white square, calculated based on the row and column where the "pawn" is located at the moment of interest. The program executes the corresponding moves until it encounters a value of 0, at which point the distance traveled by the pawn and its position are displayed on the screen.

## Another Queries

The program solves a sudoku with a given number of rows and columns, N * N. It performs various operations (6 operations to be exact) to determine the progress of the game and whether it has been completed or not.

## Functions Pointers

A program that aims to practice how to use functions pointers in different programs
